\title{Close and Remove the DuckDB Connection}
\usage{
.close_duckdb_conn()
}
\value{
This function is called for its side effects (closing and removing the
connection). It returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
This internal helper function checks whether a DuckDB connection (stored in
\code{.duckdb_env$conn}) exists. If found, it closes (disconnects) the
DuckDB connection using \code{\link[DBI]{dbDisconnect}} and removes the
\code{conn} object from \code{.duckdb_env}. If no connection is present,
a message is displayed indicating that nothing is closed.
}
\details{
This function is called to cleanly release resources associated with a
DuckDB connection in the internal environment. It can be invoked at the end
of your workflow or whenever you wish to reset the internal DuckDB state.
