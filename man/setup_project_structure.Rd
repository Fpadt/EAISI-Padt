\usage{
setup_project_structure(
  root_dir = ".",
  dtap_levels = DTAP,
  bsgp_levels = BSGP,
  functional_areas = AREA,
  project_dir = "."
)
}
\arguments{
\item{root_dir}{A character string specifying the top-level directory under
which all subdirectories will be created. Defaults to `"."`.}

\item{dtap_levels}{A character vector defining the DTAP levels.
Defaults to `DTAP` = c("Development", "Test", "Acceptance", "Production").}

\item{bsgp_levels}{A character vector defining the BSGP stages.
Defaults to `BSGP` = c("Bronze", "Silver", "Gold", "Platinum").}

\item{functional_areas}{A character vector defining functional areas within
each BSGP stage. Defaults to
`AREA` = c("sales", "stock", "promotions", "master_data").}

\item{project_dir}{A character string specifying the directory where the
`.config.yaml` file will be saved or updated. Defaults to `"."`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the normalized `root_dir`.
}
\description{
Creates a directory structure for different DTAP environments, BSGP stages,
and functional areas, and saves the root directory location in `.config.yaml`.
}
\details{
This function constructs a multi-level directory hierarchy reflecting
different DTAP (Development, Test, Acceptance, Production) environments,
each with BSGP (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) stages and designated
functional areas (e.g., "sales", "stock"). If the specified `root_dir` is
within the user's OneDrive path (either consumer or commercial), the path
stored in the YAML file will be replaced with a placeholder
("OneDriveConsumer" or "OneDriveBusiness") and the relative subdirectory
path.
