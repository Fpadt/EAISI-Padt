\title{Copy the Config Folder from Package to Destination}
\usage{
.copy_config_folder(destination_dir)
}
\arguments{
\item{destination_dir}{A character string specifying the directory where the
`config` folder should be copied. If the folder already exists at the
destination, no action is taken.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if the folder was successfully copied, or
\code{FALSE} if the destination already contained the folder.
}
\description{
Internal function to copy the `config` folder located in the package's `extdata`
directory to a specified destination. If the destination already contains a
`config` folder, the function does nothing.
}
\details{
This function locates the `config` folder in the package's `extdata` directory,
verifies its existence, and copies it to the specified destination directory.
If the `config` folder already exists in the destination directory, the
function does not overwrite it. This is useful for setting up configuration
files during the initialization or setup phase.
