## Overview

EAISI-Padt — *Pythia's Advice Datascience Tooling* — is a collection of modular R functions designed to support demand planners in time-series forecasting and data preparation. It is developed as part of the **Pythia’s Advice** project, within the final module of the [MDAI program](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/institutes/eindhoven-artificial-intelligence-systems-institute/ai-education/professional-education/programs-voor-professionals/mastering-data-ai-mdai) at [EAISI](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/institutes/eindhoven-artificial-intelligence-systems-institute).

The tools facilitate working with CSV-based datasets, which are transformed into high-performance **Parquet** files using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). All processing is optimized for rapid access and integration with Quarto reporting.

## Installation

The development version of EAISI-Padt can be installed from GitHub:

```r
# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github("Fpadt/EAISI-Padt")
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

1. [R (latest)](https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) (via `duckdb` package)
3. A project-specific config file (`./padt_config/`) must be maintained.

## Features

* 🔁 Reproducible data pipelines
* 📦 Integration with `data.table`, `arrow`, and `duckdb`
* 📊 Forecast data extraction from QAD/SAP sources
* 🔍 Hierarchical filtering and summary tools
* 🧪 Designed for scientific forecasting evaluation

## Example Usage

Here is an example showing how to retrieve forecast data for one product:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(padt)

IPM <- pa_td_sap_get(
  .ftype      = 6,        # 5 = rtp, 6 = ipm  
  .material   = "10023",  # Optional material
  .salesorg   = "FR30",   # Optional sales org
  .scope_matl = TRUE,
  .scope_sorg = TRUE,
  .cm_min     = "202101",
  .cm_max     = "202506",
  .n          = Inf
)
```

This retrieves scoped forecast data in alignment with the Pythia’s Advice modeling specifications.
