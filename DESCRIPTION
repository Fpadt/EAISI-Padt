Description: This package provides functions for the EAISI Pythia's Advice
    project.  The project focuses on time series forecasting using
    exported data.  Special functions are included to process SAP data
    exported via SAP Open Hub.  The package leverages the DuckDB package
    for data ingestion (reading large CSV files), transformation (adding
    or removing fields and applying simple transformations), and access
    (reading Parquet files with filters).
